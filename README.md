Item to Item Collaboration System



Reads customers item history and queries to create a vector of what customers have bought.

Then uses this data to find the most similar item (using angles) and gives recommendations to the customer.



To use:

* Command Line - python recommend.py
* Vscode - Just run



I copied set 1 into the folder to make it easier to run.
